# deep-icc
Term project for CISC 867 - Winter 2021
Deep learning for recurrence free survival prediction of ICC patients using image and genetic data.

## Notes
### February 15th, 2021
* Currently only have image processing code
* From_Travis contains old python code developed by Travis Williams with preliminary implementation of deep learning models
* preprocessMHA is a function version of DataGeneration
* msk_ and erasumus_ tumours.m are configuration files for the two image sets, used as input for preprocessMHA and createCSV  

### February 16th, 2021
* Finished working through createCSV, have it working with RFS labels now
* Moved preprocessing code to its own folder
* Next step is to figure out how to load images into python

### February 17th, 2021
* Had meeting with Travis about image loading code

### February 19th, 2021
* Trying to work on image loading
* Have started working on it
* A lot of Travis's code is dependent on using PyTorch, so stuff is changing for me to use Keras

### February 25th, 2021
* Going to confirm image data is getting loaded in properly
* Then finish the preprocessing on it
* Skipping data augmentation for now, will come back to this
* Starting data splitting into train and test - working in patient_data_split

### February 26th, 2021
* Moved main over to a jupyter notebook so I don't have to run the whole file every time
* Going to try train and test split with entire dataset
* Loading in data was successful, takes ~18 minutes
* Something's up with train and test split, not getting too many images in each set, doesn't add up to total

### February 28th, 2021
* Worked on draft writeup
* Found train and test split bug, was using 70 instead of 0.7 for split value and had wrong index for test_o_pat
* Have model implemented but it is vastly overtraining right now with only 700 images, going to try with more to see if it's lack of data or a bug

### March 1st, 2021
* Realized I was working with recurrence codes and not recurrence time labels
* Changed createCSV so the output has all the labels from RFS Scout included now
* Going to try to implement the DeepConvSurv model from https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7822579&casa_token=gVFzncUVfTgAAAAA:hGgPWCTzS2pUnsFG8xEZzZe7lAIupB_Z7SkKDnFJbilFmX1W6Ge5qCipPjiqCynL1lfSs64bVV4 
* Have the layers of DeepConvSurv set up
* I'm stuck on the loss function part, going to try to figure it out tomorrow

### March 2nd, 2021
* Working off of a tutorial I found that does survival analysis on MNIST data
* Can't get sksurv to import for some reason, so can't get this code to run

### March 3rd, 2021
* Got sksurv to import, just needed to install cmake in jupyter I guess
* Generated KM curve with sksurv
* Trying to use Cox PH and concordance index, following along with polsterl tutorial
* Added model architecture image to overleaf draft 
* Worked a bit on overleaf draft - model architecture description

### March 4th, 2021
* Worked on README for draft submission
* Finished commenting in patient_data_split.py
* Worked through Polsterl tutorial again, made more sense today
* Created my own set of files with the classes and functions from the tutorial 

### March 29th, 2021
* Working off of Debugging tutorial now
* Going to do some more in depth data exploration
* Made plots for patient and slice level  - in powerpoint presentation

### March 30th, 2021
* Tried loading in all of the images, but was resizing them to 1024 so it took 12 hours

### March 31st, 2021
* Ran image preprocessing to use images that are 256x256 instead and it loads in 20 minutes instead
* I ran a linear regression and it sucked but I ran it so that counts
* Have distribution plots for training and testing splits, looks roughly even which is good
* Need to finish the tutorial code I was working on at the beginning of the month

### April 1st, 2021
* Still trying to debug the trainer, something in the CPHLoss call function is the wrong shape
* So just using the code from the tutorial it works, not sure where my bug is
* Trying to plug DeepConvSurv model into tutorial code

### April 2-9th
* Got tutorial code working
* Seems like images are too much for sksurv CPH to work with
* Could try removing really tiny tumour images?

### April 13th, 2021
* Did some more model training
* Made clean versions of model code and data exploration
* Data exploration has data distributions, Kaplan Meier survival curve, Linear regression, and attempted Cox Proportional Hazards
* Main now has the cleaned model code, including the Polsterl model, DCS model, and my own best model
* Updated README to have data preprocessing section and updated file descriptions and title 
* Going to run linear regression overnight so I have those stats for report
